# Building AI Project

## Summary

This project is about creating an AI idea that helps people solve a real-world problem. 
The AI system will help farmers predict crop diseases using simple data.

## Background

Many farmers lose crops because they do not detect diseases early.

## How is it used?

Farmers can use this AI tool on their phones to check crop health.

## Data sources and AI methods

The project will use image data and machine learning classification.

## Challenges

The AI may not work well without enough training data.
